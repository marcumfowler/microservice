# microservice

We would like you to build a Microservice that exposes a couple endpoints to
return the following information. We would also like a simple UI to display the
information. 

We have provided a CSV of user information; we would like you to build to 
build the following endpoints: 
- Endpoint to return a specific user (and all associated information)
- Endpoint to return a list of users created between a date range
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on a specific profession
- Custom Endpoint that you design on your own. 

Assumptions: 
- You can build it in any language/framework combination that you like, 
or feel is best. 

Deliverables: 
- The artifacts or link to the source code. 
- Answer the following questions: 
oWhat did you think of the project? I hit a roadblock on an AutoWired Bean configuraion and was unable to produce a endpoint.
oWhat didnâ€™t you like about the project? That I chose Spring Boot when I already know how to do this with Node.
oHow would you change the project or approach? I would have used a Node backend.
oAnything else you would like to share. I am better than this.
